    """Return a factory that wraps a ``ConfigFile`` subclass for isolated testing.

    The factory creates a dynamic subclass that redirects all file operations
    to pytest's ``tmp_path``. This prevents tests from reading or writing
    real project files. The following methods are overridden to enforce
    isolation:

    - ``path()`` and ``parent_path()``: prepend ``tmp_path`` to the original
      path if it is not already inside ``tmp_path`` and the current working
      directory is not ``tmp_path``.
    - ``_dump()`` and ``_load()``: change the working directory to
      ``tmp_path`` before delegating to the parent implementation.
    - ``create_file()``: changes the working directory to ``tmp_path`` before
      delegating to the parent implementation.

    Args:
        tmp_path: Pytest's per-test temporary directory.

    Returns:
        A callable ``(type[T]) -> type[T]`` that accepts a ``ConfigFile``
        subclass and returns a test-safe subclass with ``tmp_path``-based
        file operations.
